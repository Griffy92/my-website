                <p>
                    I'm a career transitioner with a background in Account Management and Technical Operations in Ad-Tech. In this role, I discovered coding and glimpsed it's elegance of doing things efficiently.

                <p>
                    This led me to a Software Engineer course with General Assembly, which I completed recently. It was a rewarding experience where I learnt alot but at the same time, humbled by how I'm only just scratching the surface.
